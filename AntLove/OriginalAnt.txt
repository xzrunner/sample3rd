Ant v1.0, "In Search of Coke"
=============================

   Rumours through the grape vine of the local ant community indicate that
   there is a partially empty Coke can in Zoom's room.  So far many brave ants
   have gone in search of the mystic can, yet none have returned.  They are
   feared to be dead.  It is your mission as Bink to find a safe path to the
   Coke can so that others may follow.  Beware, however, for Zoom has set many
   treacherous obstacles to block you and booby traps to zap you.  Bink has
   only his cool nerves and jumping ability (the only jumping ant in the world)
   to help him on this journey.


What is: Ant v1.0 is a SCHIP v1.1 game contained in a library which includes
         SCHIP v1.1 and accessory programs written in System RPL.  SCHIP v1.1
         is accessible to run other games, such as H. Piper and Joust.

How:     Ant v1.0 was programmed using the Chipper assembler.  The System RPL
         bits were written using Hewlett Packard's System RPL compiler.
         Graphics and animation were developed on the HP48 using the graphics
         interface and User RPL.  The final directory containing the programs
         and GROBs was con- verted into a library using HP's PC based program
         USRLIB.EXE.

Play:    Enter the library menu.  Enter the Ant library.  Execute INFO.  Read
         the credits.  Press any key.  Read the key assignments.  Press any
         key.  Press BEEP (actually BEeP) menu key to toggle the RPL music.
         Press ANT to enter the title screen.  Press any key (except ATTN, will
         abort) to play the game.  Use the key assignments noted in the INFO
         program.

Using SCHIP:  Put your SCHIP program string into level one. Press SCHIP.
              You may want to put the SCHIP command in your CST menu.

Hints:    1) Pressing the jump key and the right key simultaneously will help
             clearing large obstacles.  Actually, press the jump key slightly
             ahead of the right key.  
          2) Being of little mass, Bink can stop on a dime and change course in
             mid-air at will.
          3) This game has no randomization.  Learn the terrain.

Credits:  1) Erik Bryntse:  SCHIP v1.1.
          2) Christian Egeberg:  Chipper Assembler v1.12.
          3) Andreas Gustafsson:  Original adaption of CHIP to the HP48
          4) I take full credit for the design and development of Ant v1.0.
             The game theme is original as far as I know.

Notice:   1) I take no blame for worn calculator keys.
          2) There are many tricks to getting around Ant v1.0.  Be aware of
             spoilers when posting to the net.
          3) Surprisingly only about 3.2 kbytes out of the 11 kbytes library
             are used by the SCHIP Ant game.  About 2.2 kbytes are taken by
             SCHIP.  It would not be unresonable for me to release an
             abreviated version if requests are given.
          4) Have fun and give me feedback.
